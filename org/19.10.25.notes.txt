 
Notes 25 oct 2019

Some items from here should be moved into a separate technical file
(libraries, function signatures).


1 communication between components
==================================

We had an initial UML description of the component layout ideas.


2 libraries
===========

We have settled on
+ python
+ matplotlib
+ pyqt (python bindings for qt)


3 next week, 1 Nov
==================

+ brueckentag - hope everyone is still here
+ Timur talk about GIT
+ maybe Sandra talks about a python test framework
+ Malte should set up a git account somewhere (his choice)
+ simple example of pyqt talking to matplotlib
+ could somebody explain to Andrew the plan for connecting real code
to pseudo-code ?
+ could we have some proposals for tasks and who will do what ?


4 distribution of jobs
======================

+ Lukas is the king of the GUI.
+ If Malte sets up our starting git, Malte will probably end up taking
care of it.


5 Andrew
========

+ add Timur to Stine


5.1 seminars
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Names with dates have been typed in the ZBH Wiki. Some of the times
can be moved around (from 11 to 9:30 for example). Tell Andrew if the
entry should be changed.

To get more information about the papers, you can look in google
scholar and pubmed, but for the expensive information services, go to
<https://www.sub.uni-hamburg.de/startseite.html> and look for "web of
science". I use the library's proxy (it asks for your Uni Ausweis
number), but some people use a VPN. It will do a search for
+ who has referenced this paper
+ who is referenced by this paper.


6 Optimisation Algorithm signature
==================================

We want a description which can handle various types of methods with
different requirements.

How many points describe the current state or progress ? Examples:


6.1 one point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ steepest descents
+ conjugate gradients
+ simulated annealing


6.2 a few points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ simplex (for n dimensions, we need to show n+1 points, probably with
different colours)


6.3 many points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ genetic algorithms (yuk)
+ swarm / colony methods

Does a method absolutely require gradients ?
+ yes - steepest descents, force-biased Monte Carlo
+ no - simplex, genetic algorithms, swarm


7 Cost function definition /signature
=====================================

We will start with cost = x^2, but we will need more interesting
cases.
+ even if we start with one parameter (x), we need to be able to
handle `n' parameters.
+ does the cost function provide gradients ? Must the cost function
provide gradients ? This would be a severe limitation.
+ singularities - lots of entertaining function do explode. Do we
forbid such functions ?
